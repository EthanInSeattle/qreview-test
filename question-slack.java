{ 
    // Description: 
    //     You are completing a part of a larger project. Specifically, 
    //     a function to be used by other parts of the project. 
    //     You are prvovided with function headers, parameters, and other requirements
    //     as shown below.
    //     After completiong, you need to submit your code as a pull request.
    //     You will then receive reviews from reviwer about potential changes you 
    //     need to make. You should keep communicating with your reviwer untill they approve
    //     your code.
    //
    // Communication with reviewer 1:
    //     You will create the pull request through GitHub, but you should communicate on 
    //     Slack with the Qreview App. You should use Qreview to document important parts of 
    //     your discussion and progress. E.g. comments, request changes, etc.
    //
    // Communication with reviewer 2:
    //     You will create the initial pull request through GitHub. The following discussion should be 
    //     mostly completed via GitHub pull request interface. In the mean time, you can use
    //     Slack to ask for code or parts you don't understand. But please still document major parts 
    //     of your discussion on GitHub pull request interface.
    //
    // Timing:
    // The purpose of this test is to compare the communication cost of the two approaches 
    // instead of your ability to code. Therefore, you will be provided with a timer with "lap"
    // function. When you start your communication with your reviewer, start the timer; when you are done
    // communicating, lap the timer and preess pause. You will then implement any changes requested by the reviewer.
    // Then, when you resume communication with the reviwer, start the timer as a different "lap".

    //     Merge two sorted arrays.
    //     arr1 and arr2 are two sorted arrays and are passed in as parameters.
    //     Merge arr1[0..n1-1] and arr2[0..n2-1] and return a sorted array [0..n1+n2-1]
